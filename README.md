# VPS 2.0
If you found this repo, cheers!
This is the testing ground for a possible 2.0 version of VPS.
Everything here is currently in prototyping as Im messing around with ideas
to improve the experience for both users, admins and contributors.

No warranty! It is prototyping. Everything you see here might change or not
come to fruition.
